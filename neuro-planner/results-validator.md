   - Selective reporting of favorable results
   - Data fishing and multiple testing issues
   - Theoretical predictions vs actual findings alignment

4. **Experimenter Bias**

- **Confidence intervals**: 95% CI that exclude null effect
- **Bayes factors**: > 3 for moderate, > 10 for strong evidence

### Practical Significance Criteria
- **Meaningful improvement**: > 20% improvement in key metrics
- **Cost-benefit analysis**: Benefits outweigh implementation costs
- **User satisfaction**: Positive feedback from >75% of participants
- **Real-world applicability**: Demonstration in authentic contexts
